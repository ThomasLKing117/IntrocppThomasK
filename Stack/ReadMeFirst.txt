FAILED!!!
I have the program able to push on a full stack and pop off the full stack.

I did research on a default constructor which I beleive I understand what it is supposed to do,
which it is suposed to change the default initializtion value from -858993460 to what you want it to be.

I tried many different ways to use this but none worked as far as I know, unless I was just not following through all the way
which is probably the most likely thing that happened.

This is why my program will not do what its supposed to do.

//Where do i go from here?
//1. Default constructor	(Fail)
//2. Default initialize to -1	(Fail)
//3. Paramartized constructor to allow for arbitrary stack sizes	(Did not get to do)
//4. Check if stack is empty	(Did not get to do)
//5. Check if stack is full    (Did not get to do)
