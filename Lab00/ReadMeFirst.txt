This is the ReadMe for the program MarvelVsMarvel
_________________________________________________________________________________________________

The way this program is supposed to work is that you would first double click the MarvelVsMarvel 
executable located in the same folder as this ReadMe when you first open this file, after that
you would have to refer back to the rest of instuctions which are not completed yet but would
normally be found on this ReadMe

In summary this program is useless...
