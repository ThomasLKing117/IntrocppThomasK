This is the ReadMe for the program MarvelVsMarvel
___________________________________________________________________________________________________

Instuctions will come after the following text, I want to first tell you how the program is
supposed to run in its current state.

(You may skip to the intructions on how to operate this program if you'd like)

This program in its current state will dispaly two heros, Captain America and Iron Man.

Each time you start the program they will each start at 100 health and a randomized power
that cannot be greater than 100 but also not be less than 0.

Then the program will dispaly if their health is equal and if their power is equal to each other.

Next they will fight and depending on the number generator one will most likely demolish the other
once the winner is determined the program will let you know who won and then it will terminate.
